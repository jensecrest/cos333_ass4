Jennifer Secrest, AnneMarie Caballero, Assignment 4
_______________________________________________________________________
Jennifer Secrest's Contribution:

We partner coded this entire assignment, either switching off who was
coding what when coding together or live sharing over VSCode. When
working on transforming the HTML documents to bootstrap, AnneMarie
and I both took on different documents (and I, for eample, expanded
our header html into different files depending on the page). We then
went through and coded the automatic page state updating together.
This assignment involved a lot of coding and debugging together at the
same time.

Assessment of assignment:

Jennifer Secrest: I thought this was a GREAT assignment! It built perfectly
off of our last one and it was great to get the background knowledge of HTML
and then see how much the use of Bootstrap can affect the effeciency of the
code.
