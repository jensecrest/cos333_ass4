Jennifer Secrest, AnneMarie Caballero, Assignment 3

Jennifer Secrest's Contribution:

Similar to previous assignments, we worked on a lot of parts together.
Since I had never had experience with html, I worked a lot on those
parts to gain the extra practice. Specifically, I put together the
general layouts for the header, footer, and index files, as well as the
details html files. We worked on getting the necessary variables from
the database to html. We tested and fixed bugs together, and pair coded
often, as usual.

AnneMarie Caballero's Contribution:

We pair coded most of the assignment together. Additionally, I worked
slightly more on the Flask code, as I had less experience with that.
I wrote the error HTML page, and collaborated with Jen on creating
the other page. We especially tried to work on all of the Jinja together.
Additionally, I set up the basic layout of the controller file, reg.py. 
We debugged, worked on the important processing code, and tested 
together.


Help received from other people:

We posted a few questions on Ed and asked a question to the COS 333
instructors email. In addition to anything cited, we used 
documents provided on the course page and the print-outs 
given in class.

Sources of information:
Stated above. Given through the course or cited throughout the code.
- used for casting non-int to int in reg.py

Time spent on the assignment: 8-10 hours

Assessment of assignment:

Jennifer Secrest: I enjoyed this assignment! I liked the exposure
to html and it was very cool to be able to so easily run and see
how all changes affected the final product. I can also tell
that I'm getting more comfortable with database programming.
We were impressed by the way that it built off of our previous
assignments!

AnneMarie Caballero: I thought the assignment really helped
me understand how all of these different technologies worked
together. I thought it derived really naturally from the other
assignments, so it wasn't too hard while still being really
interesting and fun. I'm really enjoying seeing our application
get more advanced and easier to use as we move it to these
more modern platforms. I think this assignment really
helped me figure out how an application like this is 
implemented. 

No known bugs.
